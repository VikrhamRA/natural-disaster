# natural-disaster
For Microsoft's codefundo event.

-I am planning to build to a Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV (Drones).
-The drones are automatically powered on in the event of an natural disaster. They are programed to automatically take a survey of the area where the natural disaster has occurred.These drones, show tremendous potential to transform humanitarian aid. Using this technology, organizations can map terrain more effectively, assess damage in real time, increase situational awareness through high-resolution mapping and deliver items faster, cheaper and more efficiently. Lower in cost, lighter in weight and quieter than helicopters or planes, with pre-programmed routes that enable them to fly in life-threatening conditions, these “digital responders” provide access to otherwise unreachable areas. In addition, infrared cameras and advanced listening systems enable UAVs to uncover survivors from rubble or among flames and live-stream night footage, increasing the success of critical rescue efforts.
-The Users can get started using map terrian and pre-program the drones to travel in the safer routes in case of the natural disaster.
-We can use the data from the seismic sensors(To detect the seismic activity in the ocean bed), the previous natural disaster data and analysis those data to predict where the impact would be the most devastating.
-Aerial technology and data prediction is used.
